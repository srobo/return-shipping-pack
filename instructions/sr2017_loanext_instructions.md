# SR2017 Loan Extension Kit Return Instructions[^1]

**Before doing anything else. Please note down the 'part code' of the Really Useful Box. This can be found on the outside of the box and will be on a sticker with either a QR code or a barcode on it. You will need this later on after the box is packaged up.**

If you require any assistance, or have any questions, please contact Rich at: logistics@studentrobotics.org

You must return the kit to us before 31st May 2017.
Please use the packaging enclosed, following the instructions provided, to package the kit.
The 'Return Shipping Pack Instructions' are written in a generic manner, so please use the following information where appropriate:

In Step 1 you are instructed to check that you have all of the parts to be returned, as specified by your Student Robotics contact. Please check that you have all of the items listed on the enclosed 'SR2017 Kit List' document.

Since the package contains batteries, you must use a courier that accepts them. UPS explicitly allow batteries to be transported as long as certain rules are followed. The packaging and labelling provided in this pack must be used as instructed to comply with these rules. Please use UPS (https://www.ups.com/uis/guest) to ship the kit back to us.

You can choose to schedule a collection by checking the box in step 7 of the UPS booking form. If you do this then UPS will collect the package from the address you specified in step 2 ('Where is this shipment coming from?'). If you don't opt to schedule a collection you will need to drop the package off at a 'UPS Access Point'.
