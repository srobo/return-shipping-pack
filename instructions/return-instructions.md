# Kit Return Instructions[^1]

**Before doing anything else. Please note down the 'part code' of the Really Useful Box. This can be found on the outside of the box and will be on a sticker with either a QR code or a barcode on it. You will need this later on after the box is packaged up.**

If you require any assistance, or have any questions, please contact Rich at: <logistics@studentrobotics.org>

Please use the packaging enclosed, following the instructions provided, to package the kit.
The 'Return Shipping Pack Instructions' are written in a generic manner, so please use the following information where appropriate:

In Step 1 of the Return Shipping Pack Instructions you are instructed to check that you have all of the parts to be returned, as specified by your Student Robotics contact. Please check that you have all of the items listed on the enclosed 'Kit List' document.

Since the package contains batteries, you must use a courier that accepts them. UPS explicitly allow batteries to be transported as long as certain rules are followed. The packaging and labelling provided in this pack must be used as instructed to comply with these rules. Please use UPS to ship the kit back to us. You can access the shipping form on the UPS website by selecting `Ship` from the `QUICK START` menu at the top left or, alternatively, visit the URL below to go straight to it:

`https://www.ups.com/ship?loc=en_GB`

**Note that the `en_GB` part is important to ensure that you're using the UK UPS website.**

The first stage of this process is to enter your address. Later on in the process you have the option of arranging for UPS to collect the package from this address.

The address to return the kit to is (this is not a residential address):

~~~
Company: Student Robotics
Address line 1: Lytchett House 13 Freeland Park
Address line 2: Wareham Road
Address line 3: Lytchett Matravers
Post town: Poole
Postcode: BH16 6FA
Email: logistics@studentrobotics.org
Please tick to 'Sent Student Robotics updates on this shipment'
~~~

You will need the following information when entering the packaging details in Step 2 of the UPS form:

 * Packaging type: Other/Customer Packaging
 * Weight: 6kg
 * Dimensions: 48cm x 39cm x 20cm
 * Value: £500

Please select `Yes` for `Reference Numbers (Free)` and set `Reference No. 1` as follows:

 * Reference No. 1: `kitreturn-[PARTCODE]` replacing `[PARTCODE]` with the part code of the Really Useful Box that you noted down at the start. For example, if the part code was `BANANA`, Reference No. 1 should be set to `kitreturn-BANANA`.

In Step 3 of the UPS form you can optionally choose to schedule a collection. If you do this then UPS will collect the package from your address (the one you entered at the very start). This adds approximately £4 to the total. If you do not opt to have the package collected you will need to drop it off at a UPS access point.

Please ensure that the package is set to be delivered to the receiver, rather than having it held at a UPS location.

Select `by End of Day (UPS Standard)` for the service.

If at any point you are asked about the battery contents, the batteries as classified as follows: "Lithium Ion. Packed with equipment. Batteries less than 100Wh".

Once you have sorted out the shipping and sealed the shipping label into the document pouch please email <logistics@studentrobotics.org> to notify Rich that you have shipped your kit.
